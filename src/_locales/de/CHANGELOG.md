## 2018-05-26 based on [Version 1.5.5](https://github.com/ssborbis/ContextSearch-web-ext/commit/2bf43ef21620fc9cc4722acc23f409c8ec1056b2)
Initial commit for german locales

### Translations used for standing terms
* Custom Search     = Benutzerdefinierte Suche
* Quick Menu        = Schnellmen端
* Search Actions    = Suchaktionen

### Display breaking term
Some terms might break the setting pages layout, especially in the overlay version.
* "IconSize"
* "SearchEngines" (because an icon is added on activating the menu and thus "Help" breaks)
* "Save" and "Cancel" (Buttons too short for translation)

### Troublesome translations
* Schnellmen端 sounds somewhat bad. Maybe QuickMen端 as a "trademark" term would be nicer...
* "AddCustomSearchMenuTooltip": "... prevent a tiered menu ..."

### Derevations from English source
* Occasionally the term "popup" is used for the Quick Menu. Translated them as Quick Menu (=Schnellmen端), because otherwise two terms describe the same thing and may add confusion in relation to the context menu as separate display option.
